        <h3>Camping at Sussman Farms:</h3>
        <p>
            The most affordable (and probably most beautiful option) is to camp in tents at 
            Sussman Farms. There is space for a small group of folks to camp out. Please let 
            us know if youâ€™d like to camp out, and if you would like to rent gear please email 
            Anna at <a href="anna.windman@gmail.com">anna.windman@gmail.com</a> to coordinate.
