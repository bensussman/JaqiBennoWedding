            *We would really love to minimize the number of cars being used during the weekend. 
            If you need help finding a ride from the airport, are interested in splitting a 
            rental car, or are renting a car and have some extra room to help drive other 
            friends to Sebastopol or to and from any of our weekend events,
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ewlWJz9wGF0ZFwddIs1yKZHMkdng6Mjf06D5kAy1_lw">please fill out our rideshare form here.</a>*
        </p>
        <p>
            For folks coming from the east coast, we recommend flying into 
            San Francisco (SFO) or Oakland (OAK). From there, itâ€™s about an
            hour north drive to Sebastopol. 
        </p>

            Folks coming in from the west coast, we recommend flying into 
            Sonoma County Airport in  Santa Rosa. There are direct flights 
            from  many major west coast cities, and the drive to Sebastopol 
            is only 15 minutes or so.

            From the airport, you can rent a car, split a rental with others 
            arriving around the same time

            or take the Sonoma County Airport Express shuttle to the Santa Rosa 
            Park &amp; Ride (for more information and to buy tickets, click here). 
            If you need help arranging a pickup from the shuttle, please let 
            us know.
