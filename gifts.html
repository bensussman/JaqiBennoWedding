            Something we'd both love is art to help us decorate our house in Brooklyn! 
            Anything from paintings, photos, pottery, antiques, whatever you think we'd love.

            Also- as you know, Sonoma County was recently hit by a series of wildfires, 
            causing billions of dollars in damage. If you are able, we encourage you to 
            donate to any fund helping to repair damage caused by these wildfires. We
            recommend <a href="http://undocufund.org/">UndocuFund</a> which provides relief to 
            undocumented immigrants affected by the fires who cannot apply for FEMA due 
            to legal status.
