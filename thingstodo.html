    <h1>Things to do in the area</h1>
    <p>
      There are so many great things to do in the area, here are some
      of our favorite things to do when visiting Sonoma County:
    </p>
    <ul class="advice">
      <li>See beautiful redwoods and go hiking in
        <a href="https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=450">Armstrong Woods</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Eat a cinnamon roll the size of your head at
        <a href="http://www.wildflourbread.com/">Wild Flour Bakery</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Go kayaking along the
        <a href="http://www.russianrivertravel.com/canoeing.htm">Russian River</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Head to the beach at
        <a href="http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=451">Bodega Bay</a> and eat life changing
        <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-boat-house-bodega-bay">fish and chips and clam chowder</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Eat at the taco trucks on Santa Rosa Avenue.</li>
      <li>Visit the <a href="http://www.in-n-out.com/#close">In-N-Out Burger</a> in Rohnert Park.</li>
      <li>Visit the <a href="http://www.in-n-out.com/#close">In-N-Out Burger</a> in Petaluma. </li>
      <li>Visit the <a href="http://www.in-n-out.com/#close">In-N-Out Burger</a> next to SFO.</li>
      <li>Walk up Florence Avenue to see the ever-changing metal junk-art statues by Patrick Amiot, our local Roma metal-worker.
        A bare-breasted mermaid with tin-can lid scales on her tail! Three strong men standing on each others' shoulders!
        A Grateful Dead Skeleton on a motorcycle!  Batman with a belt and eyes that light up at night!
        Three turkeys and an Indian riding shotgun on an oil drum horse!
        And a Tyrannosaurus Rex poised to consume the neighborhood!
      </li>
      <li>Play bocce on the back patio at <a href="http://www.underwoodgraton.com/">Underwood Bar and Bistro</a> -
        a perfect expression of West County in style and clientele, good cocktails and always fresh Blind Pig
        (a legendary California IPA) always on draft.
      </li>
      <li>Go for a swim at <a href="https://parks.sonomacounty.ca.gov/Visit/Steelhead-Beach-Regional-Park/">Steelhead Beach</a>
        on just north of Forestville (take Mirabel road from the center of town up
        till you hit the river), or book a canoe trip on the river at a nearby outfit there.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy pints or a giant flight of <a href="https://russianriverbrewing.com/">Russian River beers</a>
        in their brewpub in Santa Rosa. A truly world-famous brewery that is alive every minute that they're open,
        they offer world renowned sour and traditional beers. Biker bar type feel but with very attentive service,
        and pizzas that feel exactly the right quality for that place.
      </li>
      <li>
        Buy a bag of oysters at <a href="https://www.tomalesbayoystercompany.com/">Tomales Bay Oyster Company</a>
        just south of Marshall and shuck them on the shore - minimal
        facilities, so BYO beer, wine, bread, cheese, avocados, and hot sauce! Chuck the shells right back into the water.
        For a more refined approach with a full bar and a full menu, head just north up the road into Marshall for Hog
        Island Oyster Company. Either of these places is worth the drive, and you can swim or do some light fishing on the
        way at Keys Creek (can't miss it on the way out to the shore).
      </li>
      <li>Go for a day hike in <a href="https://www.nps.gov/pore/index.htm">Point Reyes National Seashore</a> park.
        Visitor center is about 40 minutes away from Sebastopol,
        where they can suggest hikes of varying lengths, difficulties, and amount of sun or wind exposure. A truly diverse
        paradise where you can get any type of hike you want. You may run into people on horseback and will be very jealous.
        Or, you can book a horseback tour of the park at Five Brooks Ranch (I've never been but I can't imagine it'd be bad!).
        Go to Cowgirl Creamery in Point Reyes Station to stock up on picnic fare for your hike / ride, and maybe go back into
        town afterward to explore the rugged coastal art scene.
      </li>
      <li>Find the aggressively hidden hamlet of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolinas,_California">Bolinas</a>.
        Before GPS was prominent, residents removed all road signs identifying the
        town, but it has some weird shops, galleries, hiking trails, and most importantly a culturally important surfing scene,
        paddle boarding scene, and kite surfing scene. Lagoon-meets-raw ocean in a quirky seaside village set amidst a wildlife sanctuary.
      </li>
      <li>Go wine tasting around Sonoma County. Great places nearby are Lynmar Estates, just north of Sebastopol, nestled in a beautiful
        secluded spot. Merry Edwards is more easily spotted off 116 just north of Sebastopol, but the Chardonnay is killer!

          <a href="https://www.francisfordcoppolawinery.com/">wineries</a>
          and go wine tasting.
      </li>
      <li>Take a morning <a href="http://openskyretreatspace.com/yoga-meditation-workshop/">Yoga class with Ruth Mankin</a>
        at the dance studio in downtown Sebastopol and grab brunch (California cuisine - lots of avocados!) at Gypsy Cafe.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hike the Pomo Canyon / Red Hill loop trail. Park at Shell Beach on Bodega Bay, and start the trail across the street
        (the street being Hwy 1). The hike is a 6 mile moderately trafficked and only mildly vigorous loop that features a variety of
        ecosystems, views of the ocean and the Russian River, and redwood forest patches.
      </li>
      <li>Get calamari and chips at the Boathouse in Bodega Bay, and drive out to Bodega Head to spot gray and humpback whales, then
        go hike up the Red Hill trail from the Shell Beach trailhead through windblown cedars and redwoods to look at the ocean when the sun is going down.
      </li>
      <li>Take a bottle of good local wine, fresh fruit, olives, Sonoma County cheese, and Village Bakery 3-seeded sourdough bread down the hidden
        1/3 mile-long trail to Pinnacle Gulch near Bodega Bay.  The Sussman-Hirschfelds have always considered this to be "our private beach"
        (Sarah and Ben first arrived at Pinnacle Gulch as tiny babies bundled up in baby backpacks, and both practiced crawling in and eating the salty sand).
